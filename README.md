# AutomatedEconomicAnalysis

This is the README file with the code creating posts for https://twitter.com/EconomicsShiny

Note: in the code you will see a reference to the file "Credentials.R". This file contains information needed to download data from FRED (fred.stlouisfed.org), to post to Twitter, and to send emails via GMail. 

The most important one is access to FRED, since that's where all the data comes from. The connections to Twitter and GMail can easily be commented out. Check the information in the packages fredr, rtweet, and gmailr on how to set this up.
